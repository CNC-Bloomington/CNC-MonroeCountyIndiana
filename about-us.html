					Who Are We?

				<div>
					<p>
						Care Not Cages is an independent, grassroots organization made up of residents who are committed to building care for people in our community.
						$330 million is a once-in-a-generation investment.
						We can either use the money on solutions such as permanent supportive housing, transportation, and long-term substance use treatment or we can dump more money into a system which has proven it doesnâ€™t work.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our community has a choice. We can invest millions of dollars into building a new jail or invest in solutions to make jail obsolete.

					<a href="trytwo.html"> History </a> of the Fight in Monroe County
				</div>
				<hr class="hr-main">
				<div>
					In 2008, after years of neglect, Monroe County was sued by the ACLU because of poor conditions within the jail.
					This was the catalyst of the modern fight against carceral expansion here in Monroe County.
					Decarcerate Monroe County or DMC formed to do the same thing we're doing today, to fight against putting more people in a new facility they will neglect just like the current one. DMC won their fight and disbanded in 2012, but the lessons they learned lived on. 
					In 2022, with the announcement of the current jail push, Care Not Cages was formed by a whole new group of people drawing on the knowledge learned from DMC's fight.

					How Do I Get Involved?
				</div>
				<hr class="hr-main">
				<ul>
					<li>
						Coming to meetings is a great way to get introduced to the struggle. Care Not Cages meets at 6 every Wednesday at the Overlook (611 W 12th st.)
					</li>
					<li>
						Talk about the project online. Government people are people too, they also spend way to much time online and sadly let internet discourse influence and guide their decision making. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Talk to friends, coworkers, strangers. Bad government thrives when people aren't paying attention.
					</li>
					<li>
						Organize a demo. Get a couple friends, make some noise, have fun! Direct action and protests can be fun and easy.
					</li>
				</ul>
